This study aims to explore and compare the activity patterns in two distinct areas of Montreal across different population segments over a decade. Utilizing data from the Origin-Destination surveys of 2003 and 2013, the research focuses on five primary activities: work, study, shopping, leisure, and others. The methodology involves a series of detailed steps:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: Initially, the frequency of each activity type per day is assessed. This step helps in identifying how often people engage in various activities on a daily basis.

2. **Departure Time Distribution**: After determining the most common frequency for each activity, the study examines the distribution of departure times. This phase sheds light on when people typically start their activities.

3. **Activity Duration Analysis**: For the most frequently chosen departure hour, the duration of each activity is calculated. This aspect offers insights into how long people spend on each activity.

Throughout the analysis, the study pays close attention to differences between the two population segments and regions, as well as changes over the 10-year span. The key tool for comparison is the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test), which helps in determining if the observed distributions in different segments, regions, or survey years come from the same underlying population. A type-1 error threshold is set at 10% (ùõº = 0.10), ensuring robustness in statistical inference. The results, including test statistics and p-values, are either incorporated into the graphs for ease of interpretation or presented in separate tables.

In addition to this academic focus, there's an intention to showcase the practical application of handling Origin Destination Matrix data using Python for data visualization purposes. This repository will serve as a guide, demonstrating the use of Python in processing, analyzing, and visualizing such complex data sets, making it an invaluable resource for both researchers and practitioners in urban studies and transportation planning. The conversational style of this explanation is aimed at making the study approachable and comprehensible to a wide range of audiences, including those without a deep statistical background.
